    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am a high school student graduating from Bina Bangsa School PIK and am keen to pursue a degree in computer science this coming winter. Throughout my school journey, involvement in different aspects of society has shaped me and contributed to my adaptive character. As an enthusiast for exploring new ideas, I have gained a lot of experiences beyond the school walls, acquiring abilities to work in a team and sustain good communication with peers while maintaining academic excellence.
